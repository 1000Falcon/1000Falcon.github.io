# Parallel Imaging History

## The first method started in k-space

###### Carlson recognized early that one could accelerate  
###### image acquisition using a combination of both phase-encoding gradients and RF coils to reconstruct an image. The method that he proposed worked directly in the k-space (or raw data) domain using a specifically constructed head coil, which generated a homogeneous sensitivity pattern in one channel of the coil, and a linear gradient in the other channel. Using this specifically designed coil array, their reconstruction method used a Fourier series expansion to reconstruct the unfolded image data directly in k-space. This method successfully reconstructed phan tom data as early as 1989 and in vivo reconstructions were acquired using this method as early as 1993. Unfortunately, an abstract containing these in vivo images was rejected from the SMRM in 1994, and these images remained relatively unknown until the 2004 Second International Workshop on Parallel Imaging in Zurich.
